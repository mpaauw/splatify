# splatify
A small project that demonstrates the Spotify API, built using AngularJS and C#.

Current live build can be found here: http://splatify.apphb.com/

### What does it do? ###
Splatify is capable of using Spotify's robust Web API to perform speedy account authorization and playlist creation logic. When you visit the above URL, you'll be prompted to log into your Spotify account for authorization, either by using your Spotify credentials or logging in through Facebook.

Once your account has been authorized, you will be returned to the Splatify home page. From here, you can choose one of your favorite artists and hit the green 'Search' button.  Splatify will then pull API data directly from Spotify and build you a curated playlist that contains a collection of the most popular songs from the top artists related to your search term. This playlist (titled: '[your search term]: Related Artists') will then be added to your account, and should show up on your Spotify profile within seconds.

### Getting Started ###
All .config files have been omitted from this repository for privacy purposes, and may need to be created locally if you wish to run the code directly from the source. Otherwise, the data contained within this repository is intended to be purely informational.

More documentation coming soon.
